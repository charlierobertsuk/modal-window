# Modal Window Website

Welcome to my **Modal Window** website repository! This is a simple web project I built as part of my learning journey through the **Udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course"** by Jonas Schmedtmann. You can find the course here: [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, focusing on creating an interactive modal window interface.

## About This Project

The Modal Window website features a clean, responsive design with multiple buttons that trigger a single modal window. The modal can be opened and closed through various interactions, showcasing fundamental web development techniques taught in the Udemy course.

### Skills Applied
This project applies the following concepts from the course:
- **DOM Manipulation**: Toggling classes to show/hide the modal and overlay.
- **Event Listeners**: Handling clicks on buttons, overlay, and keypresses (Escape).
- **Loops**: Iterating over multiple buttons to attach event listeners.
- **CSS Styling**: Positioning, transitions, and responsive design with a gradient background.
- **HTML Structure**: Semantic markup for accessibility and clarity.

## Features
- **Multiple Triggers**: Three "Show Modal" buttons to open the modal window.
- **Modal Display**: A centered modal with sample text and a close button.
- **Overlay Effect**: A blurred, semi-transparent overlay behind the modal.
- **Close Options**: Close the modal by clicking the "×" button, the overlay, or pressing the Escape key.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with a flexible layout.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The HTML structure with buttons, modal, and overlay.
- `style.css`: Styling for the layout, modal, and overlay, including a gradient background.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for opening and closing the modal with event handling.
